## üî® Challenges

<b>This is my most significant Full-Stack project to date, and I learned a lot of new things in the process.</b>

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Design /w Styled-Components
I like to begin with Figma to ensure a good design before starting the coding process. My biggest challenge was developing the Beatmaker since it has many functionalities, and I wanted to ensure that the user was not overwhelmed or confused by them. So, I came up with the idea of an animated menu. 

Also, since the grid are generated using mapping, it was challenging to change the color of individual cells when the user clicks on them. I resolved the issue by passing a function as a prop that determines which color to apply based on the parameters.

### üéπ Sequencer
This is the main feature of my website and this is where I spent most of my time. Finding a way to synchronize everything in a loop and only play the note that the user selected was difficult, especially while ensuring that the code remained clean and easy to read. 

The pagination was not initially intended, I was very happy on having it. It was easy to add more <i>grids</i> and managing them with CSS overflow but it wasn't clean enough for me. To fix that, I found a way to slice the grid while preserving the complete sequence array.

I really pushed myself with this challenge, and that's what I love about programming.

### üîë Authentification

Although I had never implemented my own authentication system, I was eager to acquire this skill. I learned about HTTP Headers, Cookies, Passport middleware, Cryptography and JSON Web Token. I can now use this authentication system for future projects.

### üêõ Bug controls
I'm doing the best I can to fix every little bug that could happen. I assumed that implementing straightforward features like deleting an account or commenting on a beat would be simple. However, I did not anticipate the number of actions that needed to be taken afterward. 

I had to play a lot with the backend. For example, if a user deletes their account, I have to remove their beats from the database and also remove their likes on other beats from the beat array where they were stored

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Backend
- ``cd backend``
- ``yarn install``
- Generate a public key and a private key running node on ``generateKeypair.js``
- Create a `.env` with these variables :<br/>
``MONGO_URI= (your MongoDb connection string)``<br/>
``CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET= (your Cloudinary secret key)``<br/>
``PRIVATE_KEY2= (copy/paste between apostrophe('') the crypto private key that you generated before) ``<br/>
- in ``index.js`` remove ``res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://beatmi.onrender.com");``<b>(line 53)</b><br/> and uncomment ``res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:3000");``
- ``yarn start``

### Frontend
- ``cd frontend``
- ``yarn install``
- Create a `.env` with these variables :<br/>
``REACT_APP_SERVER_URL= "http://localhost:8000"``<br/>
``REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_URL= (your Cloudinary upload url)``<br/>
``REACT_APP_PRESET_NAME= (your Cloudinary preset name)``<br/>
- ``yarn start``
